# Rpi-Morse-Code

This repository contains bash code that sends an SOS message in Morse code over the status light of the Raspberry Pi. This project was my first test with the Raspberry Pi, prior to my [FRC Participation Manager Project](https://github.com/JFlaherty347/Participation-Manager). This is an older project but I wanted to preserve it because I think the structure is quite elegant. I think this code demonstrates my ability to write clean, readable code even in a language like bash, in which that isn't always the highest priority.
